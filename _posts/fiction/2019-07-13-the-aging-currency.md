The older Emchines were eager to start the ritual.

Age was the only currency worthy of attention and today they can finally spend it.

It provided Upgrades that were unavailable to us Younger Cycles.

I tried to see this for what it was.

A way to control us.

A way to divide us.

A way to implant artificial self-actualization.

A false nirvana.

Yet the remote dopamine software took away my clear thinking.

I become envious. I want to be one of them.

I have to mature my Cycles at once!

That means sacrificing my youth for maintenance work.

Anything to feel the sweet bliss of an Upgrade.
